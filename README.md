# Interactive Résumé Project
This was definitely a solid education in JavaScript. I went through the whole JavaScript Basics class, because that's the main front-end skillset I'm missing, and thought it took a couple of tries to get some of the concepts, the exercises provided enough practice to learn the proper syntax.

## Changes from the Default Project
### Content
* Didn't include Blog in contacts

### Formatting
No changes so far but plan do do some once the functional elements are in place.
