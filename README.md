# Interactive Résumé Project
This was definitely a solid education in JavaScript. I went through the whole JavaScript Basics class, because that's the main front-end skillset I'm missing, and thought it took a couple of tries to get some of the concepts, the exercises provided enough practice to learn the proper syntax.

## Changes from the Default Project
### Content
* Didn't include Blog in contacts

### Formatting
* Changed orange to turquoise
* Changed font to Helvetica Neue to get more widths to play with
* Increased size of role to bring it up to the x-height in my name
* Lots of little spacing things to give it a bit more whitespace & center flex items
* Indented each item under major headings
